# Project
This project aims to analyze and model serious crimes in the city of Louisville, Kentucky,
utilizing a diverse dataset comprising crime incident reports, police division data, and
weather information. The primary objectives of this study are to define and classify
serious and violent crimes, isolate a specific police district for comparative analysis,
and employ linear regression techniques to identify key factors influencing crime rates.
Additionally, temperature data from the Louisville area will be integrated into the
analysis to investigate its impact on crime patterns. Furthermore, the study seeks to
introduce a novel feature related to holidays and assess its correlation with crime
occurrences. The research acknowledges the challenge of comparing crime reporting
methodologies before and after 2022, as well as changes in offense codes in 2023.
The dataset includes essential attributes such as incident number, dates, offense
classification, location details, and police division information, facilitating a
comprehensive examination of crime trends and contributing to enhanced crime
prevention strategies in Louisville. This project aligns with the broader goal of
improving law enforcement and public safety efforts within the Louisville Metro Police
Department.
